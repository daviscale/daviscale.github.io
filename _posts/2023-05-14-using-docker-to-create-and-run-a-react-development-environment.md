## Using Docker to Create and Run a React Development Environment

As a software engineer, managing different versions of SDKs used to frustrate me. Each language has its own version management tool. Ruby has  `RVM` or `rbenv`, Python uses `pyenv` or `virtualenv`, Java has `SDKMAN`, and so on. Once I started using Docker, I realized that I no longer needed to manage language versions directly on my development workstation. I now strive to install all my development dependencies in docker containers.

However, it may not always be straightforward to bootstrap a new project with Docker. This article explains how to create and run a new react project inside docker containers. I run Ubuntu via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Docker Desktop. For reference, here's my verion numbers:

- Windows version 10.0.19044.2965
- Ubuntu 22.04.2 via WSL version 1.2.5.0
- Docker Desktop 4.14.0

## Creating a react app inside a docker container

Our first goal is to create a new React app by running `create-react-app` inside a docker container. Here's a docker command to start a shell session on a `node` container:

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) -it --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" node:18-alpine sh
```

Let's unpack those `docker` arguments one at a time. `--rm` ensures that the container is automatically removed when it exits. This is intended to be a one-time-user container, so removing it is appropriate. `-v $(pwd):$(pwd)` mounts the current working directory on the host system to the same location on the container. `-w $(pwd)` sets the current working directory for the container user. `-it` allows an interactive session to run on the container. 

Inside a container, the default user is `root`. If `root` runs `create-react-app`, then the files generated by that command will be owned by `root`. `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"` runs the container as the current user on the host system. This argument is only required on Linux as Docker installations on macOS and Windows have workarounds for this issue. 

Below is the result of the `docker run` command:

```
daviscale@host-system:~$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) -it --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" node:18-alpine
sh
Unable to find image 'node:18-alpine' locally

Status: Downloaded newer image for node:18-alpine
/home/daviscale $
```

Now, we can run `npx create-react-app my-app` on the container shell prompt:

```
/home/daviscale $ npx create-react-app my-app
Need to install the following packages:
  create-react-app@5.0.1
Ok to proceed? (y) y
```

After typing in "y", we are presented with a couple progress bars and then a git exception:

```
Git repo not initialized Error: Command failed: git --version
    at checkExecSyncError (node:child_process:885:11)
    at execSync (node:child_process:957:15)
    at tryGitInit (/home/daviscale/my-app/node_modules/react-scripts/scripts/init.js:46:5)
    at module.exports (/home/daviscale/my-app/node_modules/react-scripts/scripts/init.js:276:7)
    at [eval]:3:14

    at [eval]-wrapper:6:22 {
  status: 127,
  signal: null,
  output: [ null, null, null ],
  pid: 84,
  stdout: null,
  stderr: null
}
```

This occurs because `git` is not installed on the container. It does not impact the creation of the app though, so it can be ignored. The `create-react-app` output ends with:

```
We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
npm notice
npm notice New minor version of npm available! 9.5.1 -> 9.6.6
npm notice Changelog: https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v9.6.6
npm notice Run npm install -g npm@9.6.6 to update!
npm notice
```

Let's exit the container and verify that the react files are available on the host system:

```
daviscale@host-system:~$ ls -la my-app
total 732
drwxr-xr-x   5 daviscale daviscale   4096 May 13 19:25 .
drwxr-x---   5 daviscale daviscale   4096 May 13 19:20 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 daviscale daviscale    310 May 13 19:25 .gitignore
-rw-r--r--   1 daviscale daviscale   3359 May 13 19:25 README.md

drwxr-xr-x   2 daviscale daviscale   4096 May 13 19:25 src
```

The app can be set up for version control now:

```
daviscale@host-system:~/my-app$ git init
daviscale@host-system:~/my-app$ git commit -a
```

## Creating a docker container to run the react app

We have our react's app source files, but now we need a container to run the app. To achieve this, we need two files: `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

Dockerfile:

```
# Use the Active LTS (long-term support) version of Node.
# At the time of writing, it's node 18. alpine results in
# smaller image size
FROM node:18-alpine

# change the working directory on the container
WORKDIR /app

# copy all files to the container
COPY . .

# start the app
CMD [ "npm", "run", "start" ]
```

docker-compose.yml

```
services:
  my-app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - .:/app # mount the current directory on the host system to /app on the container
    ports:
      - "3000:3000" # map port 3000 on the host to port 3000 on the container
```

Add these two files to the `my-app` base directory. Then, build and run the app by running `docker-compose up`:
